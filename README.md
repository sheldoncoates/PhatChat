<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://github.com/sheldoncoates/PhatChat)

PhatChat was created to demonstrate how [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) manages connections in conjunction with web-workers. PhatChat is anonymous and allows users to create their own chat rooms and talk to anybody.

### Built With
PhatChat was built using the following technologies:
* [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

If you'd like to have PhatChat run locally on your machine (for fun or whatever), make sure you have the following prerequisites before trying to do installation.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installation

1. Once you've cloned PhatChat onto your machine, cd into the PhatChat directory and run: `npm install`. This will install all necessary dependencies.
2. Next run: `node index` in the terminal window and PhatChat should now be hosted at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:3200/)
